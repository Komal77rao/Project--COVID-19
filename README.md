# Project--COVID-19

## Project Overview

The reason behind choosing this topic was to understand better the side effects of three major COVID-19 vaccines (MODERNA, PFIZER, and JOHNSON AND JOHNSON). Some of the questions answered through this analysis are:

- How many deaths took place in COVID-19 vaccinated people in the US?
- Which COVID-19 vaccine caused more deaths in vaccinated people in the US?
- What are the major symptoms in COVID-19 vaccinated people in the US?


My analysis is based on data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ayushggarg/covid19-vaccine-adverse-reactions) 

## Database Integration

* Created an EDR of the data 
* Loaded all the datasets in Jupyter notebook
* Cleaned the datasets in Jupyter notebook using the pandas library 
* The cleaned data was imported to Postgres SQL database from Jupyter notebook using SQLAlchemy

## Data Visualisation

* Pefromeed data visualization using Tableau
* Created a dashboard using 5 sheets
* The dashboard presents the deaths and side effects from COVID-19 Vaccines across the United States of America.
